#' Do a test to suggest two possible thresholds above which generalized Pareto modelling can be performed
#' The test is written in the context of modelling residual variation in clinical lab safety data and is unlikely to make sense outside of that context
#' @param data A vector of value to use, typically residuals from a robust linear model having eliminated the baselne effect and possible a treatment effect
#' @param umin The minumum value to consider as a threshold. Because the data are residuals and will be centered near zero, it defaults to zero. Note that negative values don't make sense since the data need to be positive
#' @param umax The maximum value to consider as a threshold. Clinical trials are usually quite small, so having this as a high quantile would often result in too few observations to meaningfully model. Therefore it defaults to being the upper quartile
#' @param nint The number of positions at which to fit the EGP3 model and plot the power parameter with its approximate confidence interval
#' @param penalty The penalty function to use, if any. By default, maximum likelihood is used with no penalty
#' @param priorParameters Parameters to use in the prior distribution if the likelihood is being penalized
#' @param alpha Determines the coverage of the approximate confidence interval on the power parameter
#' @details the EPG3 model of Papastathopoulos and Tawn is fit across a range of thresholds. The threshold at which the confidence interval first contains 1, and at which the point estimate is closest to 1 are returned as suggested thresholds for GPD modelling. The usual diagnostic checks should always be performed.
