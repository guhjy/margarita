Making texmex more digestible.

When doing extreme value modelling on clinical trial data, we have to account
for baseline effects, which can get messy. margarita provides support functions
to make it less messy and (hopefully) more reliable.

margarita also provides ggplot2 replacement functions for some of the plot
functions in texmex.

The development of margarita is partially funded by AstraZeneca.
